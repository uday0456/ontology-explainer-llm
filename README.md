# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Ontology-Based Explanation Generation

## Overview
This project explores the fine-tuning of a language model (e.g., FLAN-T5) to generate natural language explanations for reasoning steps derived from ontologies. The goal is to bridge the gap between symbolic inference and neural explainability, a core challenge in neural-symbolic AI.

## Objectives
- Convert logical entailments from OWL ontologies into input-output pairs for training.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (FLAN-T5 or similar) to map inferences to natural language explanations.
- Evaluate explanation quality using standard NLP metrics and human assessment.

## Background
LLMs like GPT-4 are proficient in generating fluent text, but struggle to explain symbolic reasoning in a trustworthy, interpretable manner. Ontologies such as SNOMED CT or Gene Ontology contain rich logical structures that can be used to derive entailments. This project leverages these as a dataset for training LLMs to generate high-fidelity, logic-grounded explanations.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install requirements
3. Load or fine-tune model with HuggingFace Transformers

## Training
Train using the Colab notebook or CLI.

## Evaluation
Evaluate using ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR and human evaluation.

## Sample Output
Input:
If X is a subclass of Y, and Y is a subclass of Z, then X is a subclass of Z.

Generated Explanation:
Since X is a subclass of Y, and Y is a subclass of Z, it logically follows that X is also a subclass of Z through transitivity.

## Use Cases
- Explainable AI for clinical decision support
- Educational tools for logic and knowledge representation
